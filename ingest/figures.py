"""Resolve the public image URL for each figure in a PMC article.

A figure's real image is served from an opaque CDN path
(`cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/<shard>/<pmcid>/<hash>/<file>`) whose shard and
hash are NOT derivable from the PMCID + filename -- so the URL cannot be
constructed, only discovered. We fetch the rendered article page once per paper,
extract the CDN image URLs, and match each figure's `<graphic>` filename to its
URL. The resolvable URL is stored in `figures.image_uri`: the viewer links to it
and the vision step fetches it on demand. (The raw-file OA `.tar.gz` packages are
FTP-only, so this HTML route is the reliable HTTPS path.)
