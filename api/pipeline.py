"""Turn a question into a grounded, cited answer.

Hybrid retrieval over a candidate pool -> context assembly (dedupe, section
diversity for multi-hop coverage, budget) -> generation. Refusal is enforced in
three places, so the system never answers on nothing: empty retrieval, best
score below the relevance gate, or a generator that can't ground an answer.
