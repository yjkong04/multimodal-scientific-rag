"""Retrieval store abstraction + an in-memory demo implementation.

The store is the seam between retrieval and the rest of the app. Week 1 ships
`DemoStore` so the API returns a real, cited response shape with zero setup.
Week 2 adds a `PgVectorStore` behind the same `Store` protocol and the app
switches on `settings.store_backend` — no changes to the API layer.
